# UI-Developer-test

Hi there! I'm Jacobo Gonz√°lez and I've made this site to show you my CSS and HTML codding skills. I would like to mention before we hop in that this is my very first CSS project and I'm very proud of what I've done. So, I had to learn several things about CSS. The best thing is that I enjoyed it and I'm motivated to do more and better :)

## Enviroment instalattion

As this test was a simple site (no backend), I've used github pages in order to deploy it. Therefore you can jump into one of these links and see my test, don't forget to check it out with your mobile devices (wink, wink):

If you want to see the work locally, you just have to clone the repository and open index.html with your browser (not Sublime Text)

### That's everything I've done, I hope you like it and thank you for your time.
